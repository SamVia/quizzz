"Your company has created a new product that manages a generic warehouse (e.g., number of goods currently stored, new orders received, etc.). This product includes a ""core"" software component, plus some additional modules that can be specialized for each customer (e.g., handling a warehouse for a car manufacturer may be different from a textile industry). In order to minimize your costs, you would prefer to install this software:","As VMs running in a set of servers available on premise in the customer's datacenter","As containers running in a set of servers available on premise in the customer's datacenter","In a way that is not known by the customer; the software will be delivered online, through the Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) model","In a virtual private cloud instance dedicated to the specific customer, running on a public cloud provider",C,"SaaS allows the provider to manage a single multi-tenant infrastructure, minimizing operational and deployment costs compared to managing per-customer installations."
